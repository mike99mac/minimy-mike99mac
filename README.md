# minimy
Simple nlu based voice assistant framework

<h2>Overview</h2>
The goal of this project is to provide a run-time environment which facilitates the development of 
voice enabled applications. These voice enabled applications take the form of a 'skill' and are
simply python programs which may do normal python things as well as call speak() and listen() and
get called asynchronously when an utterance is matched to an intent the skill has previously registered.  

This is a fork of Ken-Mycroft's Minimy at: 
    https://github.com/ken-mycroft/minimy

<h2>Installation</h2>
Installation should be run as a non-root user such as 'pi'.
    $ ./install/linux_install.sh

<h2>Configuration</h2>
Basic:<br/><br/>
    ./mmconfig.py
<br/><br/>
or, for more configuration options<br/><br/>
    ./mmconfig.py sa

<h2>Running</h2>
source venv_ngv/bin/activate<br/><br/>
./start.sh

<br/>To stop<br/>

./stop.py

<br/>
These must be run from the base directory.  The base directory is defined as where you installed this code to. 
For example:

<br/>
/home/pi/MiniMy

<h2>General</h2>
The system uses ./start.sh and ./stop.py to start and stop the system en masse. Each
skill and service run in their own process space and use the message bus or file system
to synchronize. Their output may be found in the directory named 'logs/'. 

<br/>
The system relies on the environment variables
SVA_BASE_DIR and GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS.

<br/>
These are typically set in the start.sh script.

<br/>
The SVA_BASE_DIR is set to the install directory
of your system. The Google variable is set
based on where your Google Speech API key is
located. 

<br/><br/>
If you don't have a Google Speech API key you 
can get one from here ...

<br/><br/>
https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial/signup/tos

<br/><br/>
The start.sh file must then be modified to use this
key. The Google Python module actually requires this
enviornment variable but as mentioned it is typically 
set in the start.sh script. You could, if you like,
set it manually.

<br/>
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/my/key/key_filename.json

<h2>Configuration Explained</h2>

<ul>
<li>./mmconfig.py &nbsp; &nbsp; # basic</li>
<li>./mmconfig.py a &nbsp; # advanced options</li>
<li>./mmconfig.py sa # super advanced options</li>

<br/>
The system can use local or remote services
for speech to text (STT), text to speech (TTS)
and intent matching. Intent matching is accomplished
using natutal language processing (NLP) based on
the CMU link parser using a simpe enumerated 
approach referred to as shallow parsing.

As a result you will be asked during configuration 
if you would like to use remote or local STT, TTS
and NLP. Unless you have a good reason, for now
you should always select local mode (remote=n)
for NLP.

Remote TTS using polly requires an Amazon ID and key. 
If you prefer to not use polly for remote TTS you may 
choose mimi2 from Mycroft which is a free remote TTS 
alternative. You could also select local only TTS in 
which case mimic3 should work fine.

By deault the system will fallback to local mode
if a remote service fails. This will happen
automatically and result in a slower overall
response. If the internet is going to be out
often you should probably just select local mode.
The differences are that remote STT is more accurate
and remote TTS sounds better. Both are slower but
only slightly when given a reasonable internet
connection. Devices with decent connectivity should
use remote for both.

You will also be asked for operating environment. 
Currently the options are (p) for piOS, (l) for 
Ubuntu or (m) for the Mycroft MarkII running the
Pantacor build.

This system relies on the concept of a wake word. 
A wake word is one or more words which will cause 
the system to take notice of what you say next and 
then act upon this.

During configuration you will be asked to provide 
one or more words to act as wake words. You will
enter them separated by commas with no punctuation.
For example, 

hey Bubba, bubba

or

computer

Wake words work best when you choose multi-syllable
words. Longer names like 'Esmerelda' or  words like
'computer' or words with distinct sounds like 
'expression' (the 'x') or 'kamakazi' (two hard
'k's) will always work better than words like 'hey'
or 'Joe'. You can use the test_recognition.sh 
script to see how well your recognition is working.
Just using the word 'computer' should work adequately.

You will also be asked to provide an input device
index. If you do not know what this means enter the
value 0. If you would like to see your options you
can run 'python framework/tests/list_input_devices.py'.
Remember, if you do not source your virtual environment
first 

source venv_ngv/bin/activate

Things will not go well for you. 

So remember to always source the virtual environment
before you run anything. The SVA_BASE_DIR and 
PYTHONPATH environments being set properly also
helps.

You may also modify the default audio output device.
This value is used by the system aplay command 
and the system mpg123 command. To see your options 
run 

aplay -L

Which will produce a series of lines which look 
something like this ...

sysdefault:CARD=Headset

Remove the 'CARD=' and provide the value 

sysdefault:Headset

To the configuration program.

Local TTS refers to the local TTS engine. 
Currently three are supported. Espeak, Coqui
and mimic3. Mimic3 is strongly recommended.

The Mark2 does not have Coqui as an option as it
does not currently work on the Mark2. Espeak is
very fast but the sound quality is poor. Coqui
sound quality is excellent but it takes forever
to produce a wav file (3-8 seconds). 

The crappy AEC value is used to determine if the 
system needs to work around poor quality AEC or
if it does not. Good quality AEC is typically 
provided by a standard set of headphones whereas
poor quality AEC is what you normally have if you
were using a laptop's built in speaker and mic.

An easy way to test this setting in your environment
would be to run the 'example 1' skill and see how 
well it recognizes you.

Hey Computer ---> run example one

Finally, you must provide a logging level. The
characters 'e', 'w', 'i', 'd' correspond to the 
standard log levels. Specifically 'e' sets the log 
level to 'error' and 'd' sets it to 'debug', etc.

Once you confirm your changes you can see what was 
produced by typing 'cat install/mmconfig.yml'. You 
should not modify this file by hand even thought it 
may be enticing to do so.
